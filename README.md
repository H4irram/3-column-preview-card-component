## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have acquired proficiency in using proper semantic HTML and enhanced my skills in Tailwind CSS.

```html
<h1>Semantic HTML</h1>
```

```css
bg-white py-3 px-8 text-darkCyan font-lexend rounded-full capitalize font-[400] tracking-wide hover:bg-darkCyan hover:text-white hover:border-2 border-white ease-out duration-100 cursor-pointer
```

### Continued development

In the near future, my primary focus revolves around mastering JavaScript and Tailwind CSS to enhance my proficiency in web development. JavaScript, as a versatile programming language, is at the forefront of modern web development, enabling dynamic and interactive user experiences. With its extensive ecosystem and widespread adoption, I aim to delve deeper into advanced concepts such as asynchronous programming, ES6 features, and frameworks like React or Vue.js. Concurrently, my attention is directed towards Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the styling process with its modular and responsive design approach. Embracing Tailwind CSS allows me to expedite the development process while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase. By combining these skills, I aspire to create seamless and visually appealing web applications, staying abreast of the latest trends and technologies in the ever-evolving landscape of front-end development.

### Useful resources
